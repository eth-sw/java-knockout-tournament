# Knockout Tournament README

## Overview

The Knockout Tournament is a Java program designed to manage and organize knockout-style tournaments. The program handles team and player details, conducts group matches, and runs a knockout tournament with a binary tree structure. Users can input team and player information, run group matches, and determine winners based on the scoring system.

## Getting Started

To run the Tournament Knockout System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Java.
3. Locate the `Main` class in the project and run the `main` method.

## Usage

Upon running the program, users can input team and player details, conduct group matches, and run a knockout tournament. The program ensures that each player has a unique position, and teams are organized into groups for initial matches.

## Classes

The program consists of several classes:

- **Main:** Orchestrates the entire tournament, taking user input for team and player details, conducting group matches, and running the knockout stage.

- **Group:** Represents a group of teams in the tournament, generating all possible matches between teams.

- **GroupMatch:** Represents a match between two teams within a group, tracks whether the match has been played, and calculates points based on the scoring system.

- **MatchTree:** Implements a binary tree structure for the knockout tournament, allowing the program to determine the next match and progress winners up the tree.

- **Player:** Represents an individual player on a team, with a name and position.

- **Team:** Represents a team of players, with methods to add players and retrieve player information.

- **TreeNode:** Represents a node in the binary tree structure, storing information about the team, left child node, right child node, and score.

## How It Works

- Teams are created with players, ensuring each player has a unique position.
- Teams are organized into groups, and group matches are conducted.
- Winners and second-place teams from each group move to the knockout stage.
- The knockout stage is represented as a binary tree structure, and matches are played until a final winner is determined.
